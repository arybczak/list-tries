-- | The base implementation of a Patricia trie representing a set of lists,
-- generalized over any type of map from element values to tries.
--
-- Worst-case complexities are given in terms of @n@, @m@, and @s@. @n@ refers
-- to the number of keys in the set and @m@ to their maximum length. @s@ refers
-- to the length of a key given to the function, not any property of the set.
--
-- In addition, the trie's branching factor plays a part in almost every
-- operation, but the complexity depends on the underlying 'Map'. Thus, for
-- instance, 'member' is actually @O(m f(b))@ where @f(b)@ is the complexity of
-- a lookup operation on the 'Map' used. This complexity depends on the
-- underlying operation, which is not part of the specification of the visible
-- function. Thus it could change whilst affecting the complexity only for
-- certain Map types: hence this \"b factor\" is not shown explicitly.
--
-- Disclaimer: the complexities have not been proven.

-- Invariant: any (Tr False _ _) has at least two children, all of which are
-- True or have a True descendant.
--
-- In order to avoid a lot of special casing it has to be the case that there's
-- only one way to represent a given trie. The above property makes sure of
-- that, so that, for instance, 'fromList ["foo"]' can only be 'Tr True "foo"
-- Map.empty', and not 'Tr False "fo" (Map.fromList [('o',Tr True ""
-- Map.empty)])'. Base.tryCompress is a function which takes care of this.

-- | The data structure itself: a set of keys of type @[a]@ implemented as a
-- trie, using @map@ to map keys of type @a@ to sub-tries.
--
-- Regarding the instances:
--
-- - The @CMap@ type is internal, ignore it. For 'Eq' and 'Ord' an 'Eq'
--   instance is required: what this means is that @map a v@ is expected to be
--   an instance of 'Eq', given 'Eq'@ v@.
--
-- - The 'Eq' constraint for the 'Ord' instance is misleading: it is needed
--   only because 'Eq' is a superclass of 'Ord'.
--
-- - The 'Monoid' instance defines 'mappend' as 'union' and 'mempty' as
--   'empty'.

deleteMin = inTS Base.deleteMin

-- * Trie-only operations

-- | @O(s)@. The set which contains all keys of which the given key is a
-- prefix. For example:
--
-- > lookupPrefix "ab" (fromList ["a","ab","ac","abc"])
-- >    == fromList ["ab","abc"]
lookupPrefix :: Map map a => [a] -> TrieSet map a -> TrieSet map a
lookupPrefix = TS .: Base.lookupPrefix .:. unTS

-- | @O(s)@. Prepends the given key to all the keys of the set. For example:
--
-- > addPrefix "pre" (fromList ["a","b"]) == fromList ["prea","preb"]
addPrefix :: Map map a => [a] -> TrieSet map a -> TrieSet map a
addPrefix = TS .: Base.addPrefix .:. unTS

-- | @O(s)@. The set which contains all keys of which the given key is a
-- prefix, with the prefix removed from each key. If the given key is not a
-- prefix of any key in the set, an empty set is returned. For example:
--
-- > deletePrefix "a" (fromList ["a","ab","ac"]) == fromList ["","b","c"]
--
-- This function can be used, for instance, to reduce potentially expensive I/O
-- operations: if you need to check whether a string is a member of a set, but
-- you only have a prefix of it and retrieving the rest is an expensive
-- operation, calling 'deletePrefix' with what you have might allow you to
-- avoid the operation: if the resulting set is empty, the entire string cannot
-- be a member of the set.
deletePrefix :: Map map a => [a] -> TrieSet map a -> TrieSet map a
deletePrefix = TS .: Base.deletePrefix .:. unTS

-- | @O(s)@. Deletes all keys which are suffixes of the given key. For example:
--
-- > deleteSuffixes "ab" (fromList $ zip ["a","ab","ac","b","abc"] [1..])
-- >    == fromList [("a",1),("ac",3),("b",4)]
deleteSuffixes :: Map map a => [a] -> TrieSet map a -> TrieSet map a
deleteSuffixes = TS .: Base.deleteSuffixes .:. unTS

-- | @O(1)@. A triple containing the longest common prefix of all keys in the
-- set, whether that prefix was a member of the set, and the set with that
-- prefix removed from all the keys as well as the set itself. Examples:
--
-- > splitPrefix (fromList ["a","b"]) == ("", False, fromList ["a","b"])
-- > splitPrefix (fromList ["a","ab","ac"]) == ("a", True, fromList ["b","c"])
splitPrefix :: Map map a => TrieSet map a -> ([a], Bool, TrieSet map a)
splitPrefix = (\(k,b,t) -> (k,unwrap b,TS t)) . Base.splitPrefix . unTS

-- | @O(1)@. The children of the longest common prefix in the trie as sets,
-- associated with their distinguishing key value. If the set contains less
-- than two keys, this function will return an empty map. Examples;
--
-- > children (fromList ["a","abc","abcd"])
-- >    == Map.fromList [('b',fromList ["c","cd"])]
-- > children (fromList ["b","c"])
-- >    == Map.fromList [('b',fromList [""]),('c',fromList [""])]
children :: Map map a => TrieSet map a -> map a (TrieSet map a)
children = Map.map TS . Base.children . unTS

-- | @O(1)@. The children of the first element of the longest common prefix in
-- the trie as sets, associated with their distinguishing key value. If the set
-- contains less than two keys, this function will return an empty map.
--
-- If the longest common prefix of all keys in the trie is the empty list, this
-- function is equivalent to 'children'.
--
-- Examples:
--
-- > children1 (fromList ["abc","abcd"])
-- >    == Map.fromList [('a',fromList ["bc","bcd"])]
-- > children1 (fromList ["b","c"])
-- >    == Map.fromList [('b',fromList [""]),('c',fromList [""])]
children1 :: Map map a => TrieSet map a -> map a (TrieSet map a)
children1 = Map.map TS . Base.children1 . unTS

-- * Visualization

-- | @O(n m)@. Displays the set's internal structure in an undefined way. That
-- is to say, no program should depend on the function's results.
showTrie :: (Show a, Map map a) => TrieSet map a -> ShowS
showTrie = Base.showTrieWith (\(Id b) -> showChar $ if b then 'X' else ' ')
         . unTS
